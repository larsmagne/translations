1
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:07,375
In a church in southern SmÃ¥land

2
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:10,475
is our play painted on the wall

3
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:12,435
to the left when you enter the building.

4
00:01:13,165 --> 00:01:16,085
The painting originates in the
late 14th century

5
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:21,975
and the subject was formed by the plague
that visited this landscape.

6
00:01:23,455 --> 00:01:26,800
The artist is
unknown.

7
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:30,425
I have therefore called the play
Wooden Painting

8
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:33,565
and follows the painting's story

9
00:01:33,565 --> 00:01:36,875
which starts in the weapon house's
small windows

10
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,675
where the sun shines over a
still-green landscape

11
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,875
and ends four meters further in
a dark corner

12
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:47,665
where the final events happen

13
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:52,405
in a rainy, gray dawn.

14
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,375
Nobody may pass further inside

15
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:09,825
As you can't recognise us,
I forgive you

16
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:14,245
I can't help it,
but it's forbidden to cross the threshold

17
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:17,815
And why doesn't your father, brother or
husband tell us that it's forbidden?

18
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:19,315
My brother's ill.

19
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:21,935
My father hasn't returned from the war.

20
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,615
My husband died three days ago.

21
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:31,825
I'll have a word with your brother.  He
will recognise both me and my master.

22
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:35,905
No, don't.
I understand your worry

23
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:39,325
Just because we look dirty and soiled

24
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,285
that doesn't make us villains.

25
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:42,655
We've got the plague.

26
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:46,255
Oops, that's not good.
That's disgusting.

27
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:48,555
Oops.

28
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:50,515
Nobody escapes.

29
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:52,865
There's no cure.

30
00:02:53,205 --> 00:02:54,325
No escape.

31
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:57,965
Do you smell the smoke?

32
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:01,385
It's been over the woods since this morning.

33
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:05,335
When you mention it, I do feel something
stinging my nose.

34
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:08,495
They burned a witch at the crossroads
this morning.

35
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:12,145
It's considered that she's the cause of
the plague.

36
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:18,365
By the way, she did admit to having
sexual congress with...  the dark one.

37
00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:22,355
But dear, then everything well and good!

38
00:03:22,355 --> 00:03:25,215
You have to keep up with those damned
witches, whether they conjure up plague...

39
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:27,195
... or whatever devilish thing they're doing.

40
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:30,495
My master wants us to continue.

41
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:32,595
What is your master's name?

42
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:37,325
His name is Antonius Block, and he's
your master as much as mine.

43
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:42,785
For ten years we sat down in the holy
land, letting snakes bite us...

44
00:03:42,785 --> 00:03:45,855
... animals gnaw at us, heathens light
us on fire...

45
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:48,885
... wine poison us, women giving us lice...

46
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:52,075
... fleas eat is up, and fevers burn us up.

47
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:53,445
For God's honour!

48
00:04:02,215 --> 00:04:04,715
Now you're throwing twigs at me, my lord...

49
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:10,725
... but I was right.  Our crusade was so
stupid that only an idealist could have
thought of it.

50
00:04:11,345 --> 00:04:14,325
Just look at my master.  He can't talk.

51
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:19,635
The dirty heathens captured him one
Sunday morning during services.

52
00:04:19,715 --> 00:04:22,115
And they cut his tongue out of his mouth.

53
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:39,715
Thanks to me...
... the plague...

54
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:46,225
... more insulting than what we've experienced.

55
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:49,325
I don't give a damn about the plague.

56
00:04:50,895 --> 00:04:52,795
Goodbye, my girl.

57
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:55,405
Even if I lack funds for your information

58
00:04:55,405 --> 00:04:57,795
you'll have to keep an account until we
meet in heaven.

59
00:04:58,395 --> 00:04:59,675
If you get there, that is.

60
00:05:14,505 --> 00:05:15,595
They should obey.

61
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:16,915


62
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:19,155


63
00:05:19,815 --> 00:05:22,455
They haven't seen their infected eyes,
their hands

64
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,175
the blood that foams around their eyes
and mouths.

65
00:05:26,055 --> 00:05:29,315
They haven't seen the boils on their necks.

66
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:33,485
Every morning it's bigger than in the
evening.

67
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:36,285
And water and pus runs from it.

68
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:40,925
On some it grows as big as a
child's head, and their bodies...

69
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:43,935
... and their bodies shrink so their
limbs become ropes of madness.

70
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:46,375
They try to tear the boils off.

71
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,195
They bit their hands.

72
00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:50,495
They tear their veins open with their
nails.

73
00:05:50,495 --> 00:05:52,855
Their screams tear the clouds.

74
00:05:53,455 --> 00:05:56,665
Then they dance over the floor.

75
00:05:56,665 --> 00:05:59,795
Then they fall, and then they gasp

76
00:06:01,815 --> 00:06:03,065
And then they die.

77
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:05,015
In the trenches.

78
00:06:05,755 --> 00:06:06,995
In the barns.

79
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:08,665
On the farms.

80
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:10,135
In the river.

81
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,975
In the stoves.

82
00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:15,975
The people flee the cities.

83
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,325
They go north

84
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:21,385
and the entire time a shadow follows them.

85
00:06:21,385 --> 00:06:22,545
A stricter master.

86
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:25,405
New areas are hit.

87
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:27,805
It's the end times.

88
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:30,975
In the sunset it's as if you can see the
horsemen.

89
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:32,985
The wild riders of the apocalypse.

90
00:06:43,645 --> 00:06:44,645
Poor little Jens.

91
00:06:47,085 --> 00:06:48,445
How dark the forest is.

92
00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:51,255
Even if the sun has barely set.

93
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:58,395
A huge crab sits under my ribs and grabs
at my heart.

94
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:02,745
Perhaps I should try singing a little song.

95
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:10,465
In the ocean the fishes swim

96
00:07:10,465 --> 00:07:13,035
Big ships are rocked.

97
00:07:13,035 --> 00:07:15,985
Sensible people die like flies.

98
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:20,635
Are you afraid, Jens?

99
00:07:22,905 --> 00:07:23,905
Uh-uh.

100
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:28,505
Are you afraid, little Jens?

101
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:31,285
No...

102
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:37,175
Aren't you at all afraid, my poor little
Jens?

103
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:45,665
Yes!

104
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:49,115
I am so scared that an accident could
happen at any time.

105
00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:52,655
But my stomach is as empty as infinity.

106
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:57,155
But who are you, my beautiful girl?

107
00:07:58,105 --> 00:07:59,315
Aren't you afraid of the dark?

108
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:03,295
Can I join you?

109
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:07,145
My master and I are just resting.

110
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:10,075
You see, we've just strolled from the
holy country.

111
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:13,515
- So we're a bit tired, you see.
- OK, then I'll... rest, too.

112
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:16,545
Follow me into the bushes over there.

113
00:08:16,545 --> 00:08:17,765
Why should I do that?

114
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:25,095
Perhaps we could pick some blueberries,
for instance?

115
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:30,575
- It's been so long.
- If you knew who I am...

116
00:08:31,105 --> 00:08:33,955
... you wouldn't suggest picking
blueberries.

117
00:08:33,955 --> 00:08:36,535
Or anything else, for that matter.

118
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:39,195
- Who are you then, if I may ask?
- I'm the witch!

119
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,165
That they burned over at the crossroads
this morning.

120
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:46,875
Then you really shouldn't be standing
here, being dead and all.

121
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,125
Of course I'm dead!

122
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:50,575
Oh!  Then you're a ghost?

123
00:08:51,425 --> 00:08:54,585
And I don't believe in ghosts, which
means that you don't exist.

124
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:57,645
Which means that you can't be standing
there bothering me.

125
00:08:57,645 --> 00:09:00,695
Unless we're dead too, and transformed
into ghosts.  If that's the case,

126
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:03,715
then I don't give a damn, so don't say
another word until the end of days.

127
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:07,045
Perhaps you and your master participated
in the execution?

128
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:08,475
No, unfortunately!  We've just been abroad.

129
00:09:10,745 --> 00:09:13,885
Near the morning, I fell asleep for a
while.

130
00:09:14,665 --> 00:09:20,105
But I awoke almost immediately by the
crowd hissing outside the prison.  I was
afraid, and I cried.

131
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:25,375
But that didn't help.  Everything had
already been decided.

132
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:29,055
I climbed up to the little window and
looked down on the yard.

133
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:35,205
The wagon they were going to drive me
away in was there.

134
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:38,055
The priest had also arrived.

135
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:42,285
But I couldn't see whether the
executioner was there.

136
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:46,605
The sun was rising.

137
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:50,305
There wasn't a cloud in the skies.

138
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:53,355
It was completely empty.

139
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,495
I stood there, looking at the people.

140
00:09:59,485 --> 00:10:01,775
And I was able to distinguish their
faces.

141
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:05,685
And their voices entered my ears.

142
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:08,275
And they were like evil birds.

143
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:15,425
And then I looked at my hands, holding
on to the protrusion on the wall.

144
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:19,395
The nails were black with blood, and
broken.

145
00:10:19,425 --> 00:10:24,065
But my knuckles whitened, and all my
strength remained!

146
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:28,055
Then voices could be heard in the hall.

147
00:10:28,765 --> 00:10:31,685
The door was opened, and I fell down
from the wall.

148
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:36,775
I lay with my forehead on the rough
planks that stank of rotten straw.

149
00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:43,685
They bent down, took me across the
waist, and they pulled my shoulders

150
00:10:43,785 --> 00:10:47,645
and they placed an iron claw over
my neck.

151
00:10:48,365 --> 00:10:49,755
And I was cold.

152
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:52,875
So cold I couldn't speak.

153
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:54,975
Couldn't scream.

154
00:10:56,175 --> 00:10:57,675
Couldn't walk.

155
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:00,835
But they pulled on my collar.

156
00:11:01,275 --> 00:11:09,515
They pulled me down the stone steps and
through a long hall, and every time I
fell, I almost choked.

157
00:11:10,185 --> 00:11:11,925
Then they pulled on the chain.

158
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:17,565
But they didn't touch my body.

159
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:19,875
Like the other guards.

160
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:24,455
They didn't laugh and make fun of me

161
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:27,135
like those who cut my hair.  No, they
were silent and worried.

162
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:30,245
They pulled my collar and they were
afraid.

163
00:11:32,715 --> 00:11:39,175
Because they knew that He accompanied me
and hold onto my dress.

164
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:42,315
Then the doors opened and the sun struck
my face.

165
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:44,345
And there was like an outcry in the sun.

166
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:47,325
And the morning wind tore up sand

167
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:49,025
and threw it in our faces.

168
00:11:53,055 --> 00:11:54,705
I sat in the wagon.

169
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,195
Back to front.

170
00:11:57,705 --> 00:12:01,775
Tethered, so that I had to hold my head
safely against my chest.

171
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:06,315
And when the wagon shook along the road,
it hurt.

172
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:10,205
Because the iron cut into my throat.
But I didn't scream.

173
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,605
The pain helped me.

174
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:19,655
The rocks on the road helped me.

175
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:26,825
The creaking wheels helped me.

176
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:29,915
There was nothing in front and nothing
behind me.

177
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:35,355
And the sun burned in red waves through
my eyelids

178
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,755
and I heard the stamping of hundreds of
feet.

179
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:42,425
The road dust rose like smoke.

180
00:12:45,175 --> 00:12:50,315
I felt how the people around me
breathed, and how their pulses beat.

181
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:53,075
And their eyes widened.

182
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:55,055
But they were all silent.

183
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:01,175
When we reached the place by
the crossroads

184
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:03,485
they loosened my tether.

185
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:05,845
And I bent my head backwards.

186
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:12,255
Over the pines

187
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:15,685
above everything

188
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:19,255
there were streams of thin clouds.

189
00:13:20,105 --> 00:13:21,605
Like hands.

190
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:25,145
Then I smelled the smoke!

191
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:29,635
It was coming from a huge heap of
twigs and everybody started coughing.

192
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:30,685
The flames rose.  It was a huge fire.

193
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:32,485
It heated our faces

194
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:35,005
and I turned away.

195
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:43,565
And behind me, He stood.

196
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,555
And his mouth curved upwards.

197
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:52,505
And his eyes became round and clear.

198
00:13:54,515 --> 00:13:56,395
He came close to me.

199
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:03,225
I felt his breath against my cheek.

200
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:06,305
And He put His hand on my thigh.

201
00:14:11,155 --> 00:14:13,965
I turned towards the heap.

202
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:16,735
And all the people who were hiding
behind it.

203
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,565
I stretched my fingers out.  I stood on
my toes.

204
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:23,805
I stretched as far as I could.

205
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:26,395
And then I laughed!  I laughed...

206
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:32,515
But it sounds like when a small
child laughs.

207
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:34,235
So I started screaming.

208
00:14:34,595 --> 00:14:36,985
Words appeared in my scream.

209
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,395
They were like fishes in a lake.

210
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,055
Now the wheel is turning.  Now the sand
is raging.

211
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:45,805
Now the night bird is screaming.

212
00:14:45,805 --> 00:14:48,565
Now everything collides.

213
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:50,525
The viper.

214
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:52,875
Now the wheel has stopped.

215
00:14:54,075 --> 00:14:57,055
Now the holy rites are rising.

216
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:03,905
Now the wheel stands still.

217
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:06,895
Now there's silence.

218
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:09,745
Now the leap is close.

219
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:13,625
Now the sand has its own.

220
00:15:15,485 --> 00:15:18,105
Now the mountains are roaring.

221
00:15:19,555 --> 00:15:23,195
Now the river is gaping.

222
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:25,765
Now they're here.

223
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:37,715
Then they struck me across the mouth
with a cane so I fell down.

224
00:15:40,595 --> 00:15:42,485
Then they tied me to a ladder.

225
00:15:43,555 --> 00:15:45,445
And put it into the fire.

226
00:15:46,215 --> 00:15:48,955
And the flames flew up.

227
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:50,945
Enveloped my clothes.

228
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:55,245
And before I fell into the pyre with my
face first

229
00:15:56,265 --> 00:15:58,695
I burned like a torch.

230
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,805
They sang a psalm.

231
00:16:07,405 --> 00:16:10,245
But I was no longer scared.

232
00:16:12,945 --> 00:16:17,405
He held his furry body in front of
mine.

233
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:19,585
And we fell

234
00:16:20,435 --> 00:16:22,815
into a deep lake.

235
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:28,405
He enveloped me

236
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,755
and I wasn't cold any more.

237
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,325
Sorry for disturbing.

238
00:16:48,945 --> 00:16:51,815
Have any of you seen my wife?

239
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:55,275
No, we haven't seen even a cat.

240
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:56,545
That's too bad.

241
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:58,545
Has she disappeared?

242
00:17:00,905 --> 00:17:02,045
She'd gone off with a jester.

243
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:06,335
If she's got that bad taste, I think you
should just let her run off.

244
00:17:06,335 --> 00:17:08,825
Don't do her the honour of running
around the woods looking for her.

245
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:10,335
That's not it, my lord.

246
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:13,135
I had rather thought I was going to kill
her.

247
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,185
Oh, I see.  Well, that's a different
thing altogether.

248
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:19,585
I'm going to kill the cheating jester,
too.

249
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:25,545
There's too many of those, anyway.  Even
if they haven't done anything, they
should be killed.

250
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:32,275
You see, my wife has always been so
interested in...  the art of theatre.

251
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:34,575
And that was her misfortune.

252
00:17:35,265 --> 00:17:37,825
Her misfortune, but not mine.

253
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:40,315
Because one that's born as a mistake
can't be affected by misfortune.

254
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:43,895
Of what kind is self-evident.

255
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:55,305
Are you married, by any chance?

256
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:00,195
A hundred times and more.  I can't even
count my wives any more.

257
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:04,095
But it's often that way when you're
travelling.

258
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:09,315
One wife is worse than a hundred, I tell
you.

259
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,715
Or perhaps I've been struck worse than
most

260
00:18:12,785 --> 00:18:15,765
poor sods in this miserable world.

261
00:18:15,765 --> 00:18:18,375
Which doesn't seem unlikely to me.

262
00:18:18,745 --> 00:18:22,245
It's hell with women, and it's hell
without women.

263
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:25,195
No matter how you think about it, it's
always makes most sense to

264
00:18:25,195 --> 00:18:27,455
just kill them while it's still fun.

265
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:32,415
Women's whining

266
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:35,605
children's cries and pee-filled diapers

267
00:18:35,685 --> 00:18:38,475
sharp tacks and jeers

268
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:41,965
hits and slaps and horrible
mother-in-laws

269
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:45,045
and when you're going to bed after a
long day, the pipe gets another tune:

270
00:18:45,045 --> 00:18:49,365
Tears, whining, complaints:

271
00:18:50,365 --> 00:18:52,145
"Why don't you kiss me goodnight?

272
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,405
why don't you sing a song?

273
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:57,425
Why don't you love me like when we
first met?

274
00:18:58,935 --> 00:18:59,995
Why haven't you looked at my new robe?

275
00:19:01,755 --> 00:19:04,305
You just lie there and snore?"

276
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:08,365
Oh, yes.

277
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:15,395
And then that...  jester arrived.

278
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:16,645
With his stench of perfume.

279
00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:20,985
He was so full of false smiles.

280
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:27,345
And played.  Played on his goddamned
stringed instrument.

281
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:33,405
And sighted and wept, with blue eyes and
rosy cheeks.

282
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,035
And swanned around with his ass in the
air like a cat.

283
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:37,315
While my mother-in-law stood guard

284
00:19:37,725 --> 00:19:42,575
while I was made a cuckold.
- And then they sneaked off.

285
00:19:42,905 --> 00:19:47,915
I'm going to pinch them with my pliers...

286
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:49,105
I'll pound them on their chests with
my hammer.

287
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:57,515
I'll tap them ever so lightly on their
heads with my big sledge.

288
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,485
What on Earth...

289
00:20:01,795 --> 00:20:02,795
Are you crying?

290
00:20:04,105 --> 00:20:06,435
Yes, look at the smith...

291
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:11,755
He whines and he cries like a
piss-soaked rabbit.

292
00:20:12,315 --> 00:20:14,225
Now I'm confused.

293
00:20:14,855 --> 00:20:18,135
You're free from that rascal!

294
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:19,965
You don't understand me.

295
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:24,235
Your vanity is hurt.

296
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:25,425
That's something one can endure.

297
00:20:26,695 --> 00:20:28,985
Then you're not a real man.

298
00:20:29,135 --> 00:20:30,325
Perhaps he loves her?

299
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:33,285
Hah!  A ghost talks!

300
00:20:34,335 --> 00:20:36,065
"Perhaps he loves her!"

301
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,545
Listen here, you deep fried sorceress,
what do you know about love!

302
00:20:39,545 --> 00:20:42,365
What do you know about love?

303
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:45,185
Everything that's worth knowing, and a
great deal besides.

304
00:20:45,185 --> 00:20:48,065
It's another word for lust, plus lust,
plus lust...

305
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:51,225
plus a whole deal of fraud, falsehoods,
lies

306
00:20:51,225 --> 00:20:53,275
and common swindles.

307
00:20:54,015 --> 00:20:56,705
Love is the blackest of all plagues

308
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:59,915
and if you died of it, then perhaps
there'd be some point

309
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:02,695
but it almost always passes.  Only some
sheep brains die from it from time to
time.

310
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:07,945
Love is as contagious as the common cold

311
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:10,745
it steals your blood, your power, your
independence

312
00:21:10,745 --> 00:21:13,915
your morals (if you have any).

313
00:21:13,955 --> 00:21:16,645
Love is an exhausting grimace that ends
with a yawn.

314
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:22,065
If everything in this world is
imperfect, then love is most perfect in
its perfect imperfection.

315
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:26,625
Damn, all this talking makes my throat
dry.  Do you have any liquor?

316
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:30,955
You're a lucky guy, with a mouth on you
like that.

317
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:36,235
And you even believe in your own
nonsense.

318
00:21:37,735 --> 00:21:42,465
But beware: The forest is dark and night
is coming.

319
00:21:44,075 --> 00:21:46,065
Beware what you're saying!

320
00:21:46,595 --> 00:21:48,655
This is my gospel:

321
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:52,415
My small stomach is my Earth

322
00:21:53,175 --> 00:21:56,205
my head is my eternity

323
00:21:56,205 --> 00:21:57,205
and my hands is my sons.

324
00:21:57,515 --> 00:22:00,435
The legs are time's unholy pendulums.

325
00:22:00,435 --> 00:22:05,975
And my dirty feet are two marvellous
starting points for my philosophy.

326
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:11,285
My world in the Jens World, credible for
nobody except myself.

327
00:22:11,785 --> 00:22:14,075
Ridiculous for everybody, even myself.

328
00:22:14,405 --> 00:22:18,635
Meaningless before heaven and
indifferent in hell.

329
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:22,045
Everything is worth exactly as much as a
yawn

330
00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:24,815
only with the difference that a yawn is
more pleasurable.

331
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:28,145
Oh, oh, oh, now I remembered...

332
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:30,905
What are you whining about?

333
00:22:31,555 --> 00:22:34,165
Oh, I was thinking about my wife, you
see...

334
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:36,235
She's so beautiful.

335
00:22:36,895 --> 00:22:39,995
She's so beautiful you can't
describe her

336
00:22:39,995 --> 00:22:43,155
without accompaniment of a lute.

337
00:22:43,535 --> 00:22:46,125
And that's exactly what the jester did.

338
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:51,155
Her smile is like liquor.

339
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:53,865
Her eyes like blueberries.

340
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:58,295
Her behind is like a juicy pear.

341
00:22:59,135 --> 00:23:04,525
That woman is like a strawberry field.

342
00:23:04,945 --> 00:23:07,625
I can picture her now...

343
00:23:07,895 --> 00:23:09,975
with arms like lovely cucumbers.

344
00:23:10,925 --> 00:23:14,275
Yuck!  Stop!  You're a really bad poet,
despite being drunk.

345
00:23:14,275 --> 00:23:16,565
And your vegetables bore me.

346
00:23:25,135 --> 00:23:28,285
Can I come along with you part of
the way?

347
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:31,625
OK, but if you start crying again, I'm
leaving you behind.

348
00:23:33,755 --> 00:23:35,015
Oh, is the witch joining us?

349
00:23:36,465 --> 00:23:37,955
What a group of people...

350
00:23:52,225 --> 00:23:53,225
The moon is rising.

351
00:23:55,615 --> 00:23:58,655
- Then we'll see the way better.
- I don't like the moon.

352
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:02,005
The trees are so still tonight.

353
00:24:04,435 --> 00:24:07,005
That's because there's no wind.

354
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:08,845
What I mean is that they're very still.

355
00:24:11,405 --> 00:24:15,835
Bats.  They're always flying over the
road and in front of our faces.

356
00:24:21,115 --> 00:24:22,115
It's totally quiet.

357
00:24:39,675 --> 00:24:40,675
A dog's bark?

358
00:24:52,775 --> 00:24:53,775
A human voice?

359
00:24:54,555 --> 00:24:57,805
The moonlight is burning the eyes so
that one can hardly see.

360
00:24:57,805 --> 00:25:01,045
It's dangerous to stand in the
moonlight, don't you know what?

361
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:27,745
Does anybody know the right way to the
border?  These are just narrow paths,
and I'm lost.

362
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:31,725
If you come along with us, you'll
find plague.

363
00:25:32,635 --> 00:25:34,815
If you turn the opposite way, you'll
find plague.

364
00:25:35,235 --> 00:25:38,045
That is, if plague doesn't find you
long before.

365
00:25:38,045 --> 00:25:39,505
But it's the plague I'm afraid of.

366
00:25:40,215 --> 00:25:43,775
I took my little boy out of the cradle
and I've walked all day without
meeting anybody.

367
00:25:46,395 --> 00:25:47,865
Does anybody have some bread?

368
00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:55,905
Here's a piece of my last loaf.  If
you're able to chew it, you're better
than me.

369
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,965
But I've only got two teeth, of course.

370
00:25:59,635 --> 00:26:00,785
Shut up!

371
00:26:01,485 --> 00:26:04,835
The time has come!

372
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:10,075
What is that among the trees if not my
most honoured, with accompanying jester.

373
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:17,085
Be my guests; please have a seat.

374
00:26:18,065 --> 00:26:24,425
Because now there's going to be a
trial.

375
00:26:35,915 --> 00:26:37,105
My wife!

376
00:26:38,575 --> 00:26:40,875
I see that you're having a little
evening nap!

377
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:43,185
With a lap dog!

378
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:48,385
Or whatever it is that's swishing at
your left side.

379
00:26:50,045 --> 00:26:52,695
Are you the filthy smith that's
insulting my beloved lady?

380
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:56,815
My most beloved Kunnigunnan?

381
00:26:57,475 --> 00:26:58,475
Kunni-

382
00:27:00,065 --> 00:27:03,315
Lisa! Is her name.

383
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:04,625
Or slut!

384
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:06,715
Lisa Faithless!

385
00:27:07,645 --> 00:27:09,205
Ass-Lisa!

386
00:27:09,615 --> 00:27:12,955
You're good at filth; you think
something up.

387
00:27:13,085 --> 00:27:14,085
You little gilded miscreant.

388
00:27:14,705 --> 00:27:17,495
You cropped bastard offspring of seven
scabrous mongrels:

389
00:27:17,495 --> 00:27:20,165
If I were in your flea-ridden pants,
shame would have struck me down

390
00:27:20,165 --> 00:27:22,945
over my bad breath, my way of moving,

391
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:25,915
my voice; in short, my entire person

392
00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:31,625
that I would immediately liberate nature
from my awful visage.

393
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:34,055
Uh-uh.

394
00:27:34,265 --> 00:27:36,525
I'm going to smash your mouth in.

395
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:41,125
You won't even be able to perform your
tricks for cannibals.

396
00:27:43,385 --> 00:27:47,055
Heathens!

397
00:27:47,225 --> 00:27:48,225
Bravo!

398
00:27:48,315 --> 00:27:49,315
Huh?

399
00:27:49,855 --> 00:27:53,005
Now I'm going to kick you in the stomach
so your entrails are going to spurt out
your ears!

400
00:27:53,165 --> 00:27:54,285
Not as good.

401
00:27:54,765 --> 00:28:00,135
Look at me, gentlemen, poor
despondent woman.

402
00:28:01,505 --> 00:28:02,605
And then listen to these men.

403
00:28:02,965 --> 00:28:08,165
- Look at the actor.  Listen closely to
his voice.
- My voice?

404
00:28:08,165 --> 00:28:10,965
Oh, right.  My voice.

405
00:28:10,965 --> 00:28:13,915
My talent.

406
00:28:13,915 --> 00:28:15,675
Yes, imagine.  You've got a voice.

407
00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:19,765
You even have some corns!

408
00:28:19,815 --> 00:28:20,925
You can't claim to be a human person.

409
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:24,105
He's a fraud?

410
00:28:25,045 --> 00:28:28,035
I suggest that we end this argument.

411
00:28:28,035 --> 00:28:30,775
Do you drink the smith's liquor and kill
the actor?

412
00:28:34,605 --> 00:28:38,015
Please understand me, gentlemen.

413
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:40,745
When he whispered his screeds in my ears

414
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:44,265
I didn't know they were lines from
his repertoire.

415
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:49,355
When he landed me the first time, I
didn't know that that scene had
been rehearsed.

416
00:28:50,065 --> 00:28:54,895
In front of a theatre's director, or in
front of a dusty mirror.

417
00:28:55,225 --> 00:28:57,765
When his beard tickled me in a
strange way

418
00:28:57,985 --> 00:29:00,465
I didn't know that it was a false beard

419
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:03,645
And his smile...  a collection
of fake teeth that grow

420
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:06,725
progressively worse the further you get
into his mouth.

421
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:10,365
He's stolen his perfumes, he's filched
his songs

422
00:29:10,365 --> 00:29:16,475
and he's taken his gestures from
somebody else.

423
00:29:16,475 --> 00:29:21,595
But, my gentleman, is it correct to say
that an actor is a living human being
like the rest of us?

424
00:29:22,055 --> 00:29:26,825
Well, let's see if he bleeds.

425
00:29:30,695 --> 00:29:32,555
My ladies and gentlemen.

426
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:35,665
If you think I'm going to give some sort
of defence speech

427
00:29:35,665 --> 00:29:38,495
for my so-called reality, you're
gravely mistaken.

428
00:29:39,365 --> 00:29:41,815
I'm an actor without a theatre.

429
00:29:42,525 --> 00:29:46,315
A straw doll without a doll house.  A
poet without poetry.

430
00:29:46,765 --> 00:29:48,645
A lover without love.

431
00:29:49,565 --> 00:29:52,615
Even fleas shy away from me.

432
00:29:54,235 --> 00:29:58,185
Very well, my lord, I throw away my
wooden sword.

433
00:29:59,705 --> 00:30:02,305
I will not defend myself.

434
00:30:04,395 --> 00:30:08,085
You have to fight me.  Otherwise I can't
kill you.

435
00:30:08,865 --> 00:30:12,245
At least, you have to make me as angry
as I was just now.

436
00:30:12,265 --> 00:30:14,605
I take my dagger and place it against
my heart.

437
00:30:15,325 --> 00:30:18,165
Just give it a push, and my irreality
will soon change into

438
00:30:18,165 --> 00:30:21,125
a solid and indisputable reality:

439
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:25,495
The corpse's absolute tangibility.

440
00:30:39,395 --> 00:30:40,395
Do something!

441
00:30:40,835 --> 00:30:42,615
Don't just stand there.

442
00:30:43,315 --> 00:30:46,115
He's a disgrace both for himself and
for you.

443
00:30:46,255 --> 00:30:49,135
End this misery, he's asking for it.

444
00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:52,345
Well, if you don't dare, then I'll
do it.

445
00:30:54,555 --> 00:30:58,395
Ouch ouch help

446
00:30:58,735 --> 00:30:59,735
I'm dyyyying

447
00:31:01,685 --> 00:31:02,685
I'm dyying

448
00:31:08,855 --> 00:31:10,675
And that's somebody I have to be
married to?

449
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:14,015
Come along.  This is nothing to
reflect on.

450
00:31:14,015 --> 00:31:15,015


451
00:31:19,975 --> 00:31:21,325
Let us break camp.

452
00:31:22,105 --> 00:31:23,625
I feel ill at easy.

453
00:31:25,415 --> 00:31:26,415
Perhaps one has eaten something off.

454
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,635
One hasn't eaten anything at all!

455
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:31,855
Look at the knight.

456
00:31:32,255 --> 00:31:35,755
He stands there looking at the juggler,
and then he suddenly laughs.

457
00:31:36,555 --> 00:31:39,755
I don't see anything funny about a
dead jester.

458
00:31:40,615 --> 00:31:42,415
Not a living one, either.

459
00:31:51,665 --> 00:31:52,665
Have they left?

460
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:55,295
Yes, they've left.

461
00:31:57,465 --> 00:31:59,055
Then I can get up.

462
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:01,145
Where's my dagger?

463
00:32:02,175 --> 00:32:03,445
Oh, right.

464
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:11,785
I'm ashamed...  almost...  that this is
a prop knife.

465
00:32:12,655 --> 00:32:17,055
And I'm ashamed, actually, that I'm not
really dead.

466
00:32:20,845 --> 00:32:24,925
But I'm also flattered that they really
bought my death.

467
00:32:26,275 --> 00:32:31,745
I stand here, ashamed and flattered,
despite my audience having disappeared
into the forest.

468
00:32:33,135 --> 00:32:37,295
Now I feel disgusted standing here,
ashamed and flattered.

469
00:32:38,985 --> 00:32:42,155
On the other hand, I feel a certain
satisfaction of being disgusted about
being ashamed and flattered.

470
00:32:42,155 --> 00:32:44,045


471
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:50,955
All the same, it's proud-spirited being
satisfied of being disgusted about
being ashamed and flattered.

472
00:32:52,255 --> 00:32:55,185
But if I'm going to start pondering
being proud, that'll give me a headache.

473
00:32:55,185 --> 00:33:01,215
And it seems rather stupid to stand here
in the middle of a dark forest all alone
with a headache

474
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:08,335
because of my satisfaction with being
disgusted about being ashamed
and flattered.

475
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:13,765
I've come to fetch you.

476
00:33:14,215 --> 00:33:16,325
To a strict and black lord.

477
00:33:16,915 --> 00:33:19,795
He says that he needs your lute.

478
00:33:20,185 --> 00:33:22,865
You're going to play at a dance tonight
down by the border stone.

479
00:33:24,655 --> 00:33:25,675
I don't have the time.

480
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,975
My strict lord thought you were going to
respond that way.

481
00:33:29,515 --> 00:33:32,465
- He says that you lie.
- I've got a performance.

482
00:33:32,865 --> 00:33:33,865
It's cancelled.

483
00:33:34,075 --> 00:33:35,255
- My contract.
- Your contract is cancelled.

484
00:33:35,885 --> 00:33:37,555


485
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,625
My children...  my family...

486
00:33:42,045 --> 00:33:46,085
They'll manage a lot better without you.

487
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:55,895
- Is there no subterfuge?
- No.

488
00:33:58,535 --> 00:34:00,075
No loopholes?

489
00:34:00,735 --> 00:34:03,685
- No exceptions?
- No.

490
00:34:04,015 --> 00:34:05,605
There are no loopholes.

491
00:34:07,555 --> 00:34:09,445
Sounds like a strict master.

492
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:11,955
It is a strict master.

493
00:34:13,765 --> 00:34:16,555
Let's go then and find him, before he
gets pissed off.

494
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,555


495
00:34:20,815 --> 00:34:23,825
- Why are you sighing?
- I'm just sighing!  Is that against
the law?

496
00:34:23,825 --> 00:34:24,945


497
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:44,445
The wanderers are very tired.

498
00:34:45,155 --> 00:34:49,695
They've reached a glade in the forest,
and there they sink down into the moss.

499
00:34:50,385 --> 00:34:53,455
They lie there silently, listening to
their breaths

500
00:34:53,455 --> 00:34:58,135
their pulses, the wind in the tree tops.

501
00:34:59,235 --> 00:35:03,225
Maria is a bit outside the group with
her child.

502
00:35:03,955 --> 00:35:07,695
She looks at the moonlight which is no
longer silent and dead.

503
00:35:08,115 --> 00:35:10,995
It's secretive and shifting.

504
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:19,545
One morning, the holy virgin went to the
well to get water.

505
00:35:21,695 --> 00:35:27,955
The lizards scurried across the stones,
and one was in the light and one was in
the shade.

506
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:34,705
She leaned against the well and
peered down into the dark water.

507
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:37,945
Her cheeks had gotten thinner.

508
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:41,395
And her eyes had grown bigger.

509
00:35:43,215 --> 00:35:47,675
It felt heavy carrying the child just
that morning in the white heat of
the sun.

510
00:35:48,035 --> 00:35:53,105
So she cried a bit, and he tears dropped
down into the well's water.

511
00:35:54,925 --> 00:35:56,605
And when she'd finished crying

512
00:35:57,075 --> 00:35:58,605
and that didn't take long

513
00:35:59,165 --> 00:36:02,545
she felt a bit better, almost happy

514
00:36:03,085 --> 00:36:04,965
and she took some water in her cup.

515
00:36:06,525 --> 00:36:09,685
The sun sparkled in the tall pines

516
00:36:09,725 --> 00:36:14,075
and the light splashed all over her red
dress and her naked feet.

517
00:36:15,295 --> 00:36:18,475
She wiped her tears, salt stinging
her cheeks.

518
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:20,805
She drank from the fresh water.

519
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:24,765
She drank from her hands that she formed
into a cup.

520
00:36:27,525 --> 00:36:28,525
Then...

521
00:36:29,905 --> 00:36:33,205
The child moved in her womb.

522
00:36:34,795 --> 00:36:38,115
And she laughed loudly in
her loneliness.

523
00:36:39,695 --> 00:36:44,005
She straightened her back, with
arms akimbo.

524
00:36:44,585 --> 00:36:48,795
She raised the water vessel in her
brown, sinewy arms.

525
00:36:50,325 --> 00:36:54,925
The she walked the few steps up to the
carpenter's house

526
00:36:54,925 --> 00:36:57,385
She walked through the sweltering heat
of the morning

527
00:36:57,455 --> 00:37:01,145
but her steps were almost like a dance.

528
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:09,165
From the roads you could hear the
barking of the sheepdogs and the shouts
from the shepherds.

529
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:12,625
They were driving their herds to
the mountains

530
00:37:12,785 --> 00:37:15,905
to the olive groves' refreshing shadow.

531
00:37:20,245 --> 00:37:25,685
This was my song about the virgin Mary.

532
00:37:29,555 --> 00:37:32,455
We have reached the starting point.

533
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,865
By the border stone.

534
00:37:35,925 --> 00:37:41,005
You have walked in a circle and now
you're sitting, waiting and freezing in
the dawn.

535
00:37:42,495 --> 00:37:47,375
The wind is increasing and the clouds
are amassing at the horizon which is
greying in the dawn.

536
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:50,035


537
00:37:53,835 --> 00:37:54,875
Who is the woman standing over there?

538
00:37:57,745 --> 00:37:59,865
The wife of the knight Antonius Block.

539
00:38:00,955 --> 00:38:03,915
I left the farm because of the plague.

540
00:38:04,925 --> 00:38:06,485
I was one of the last ones.

541
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,315
What are you doing here?

542
00:38:09,865 --> 00:38:11,665
Do you see the fires over there?

543
00:38:12,675 --> 00:38:13,835
Do you hear the music?

544
00:38:15,065 --> 00:38:21,845
It's the other country's soldiers who
have blocked the border with a tall
fence that crosses the entire country
from coast to coast.

545
00:38:22,895 --> 00:38:24,565
There's soldiers everywhere.

546
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:28,355
Nobody from the plague-stricken country
are allowed entrance.

547
00:38:29,525 --> 00:38:31,325
We just have to wait.

548
00:38:32,455 --> 00:38:33,975
What are we waiting for?

549
00:38:34,635 --> 00:38:35,645
For nothing.

550
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:37,875
For the plague.

551
00:38:49,945 --> 00:38:51,965
Poor Atonius Block.

552
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:54,505
Poor dear; do you recognise me?

553
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,535
I can see that it's you now.

554
00:38:58,635 --> 00:39:01,655
Somewhere in your eyes, somewhere in
your face

555
00:39:01,655 --> 00:39:06,385
but hidden away, but scared, is that boy
who left all those years ago.

556
00:39:07,685 --> 00:39:10,045
Was is a good and amusing crusade?

557
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:12,595
Did you manage to kill a lot
of heathens?

558
00:39:13,555 --> 00:39:17,475
Did you ride really fast and smash a lot
of swords and lances?

559
00:39:18,385 --> 00:39:21,165
Did you pray a lot of prayers at the
holy grave?

560
00:39:21,615 --> 00:39:23,695
Did you rape a lot of women?

561
00:39:30,545 --> 00:39:31,545
Are you cold?

562
00:39:32,965 --> 00:39:34,195
Do you want to borrow my shawl?

563
00:39:35,295 --> 00:39:36,295
No?

564
00:39:36,535 --> 00:39:39,385
In the ocean fishes swim

565
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:42,165
Big ships are rocked

566
00:39:44,295 --> 00:39:45,295
Silence!

567
00:39:46,605 --> 00:39:47,605
Don't you hear that?

568
00:39:48,895 --> 00:39:50,125
What are we supposed to hear?

569
00:39:51,675 --> 00:39:54,365
Now the roosters in the other country
are crowing where the dawn is meeting
the plain.

570
00:39:55,805 --> 00:39:57,475
Now the fires are going out.

571
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:00,425
Now the wind is calming down.

572
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,825
Now the rain is starting to fall, silent
and mild.

573
00:40:09,175 --> 00:40:16,165
Now we're standing here, tightly
together, waiting for somebody that's
coming towards us from over there.

574
00:40:31,465 --> 00:40:33,145
It's a powerful man.

575
00:40:33,945 --> 00:40:34,945
A knight.

576
00:40:36,865 --> 00:40:37,865
A gentleman.

577
00:40:39,065 --> 00:40:41,455
And he's got a young girl in his
entourage.

578
00:40:41,835 --> 00:40:45,085
And a jester with his lute on his back.

579
00:40:47,025 --> 00:40:48,025
There's coming here.

580
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:53,665
They're coming here, to us, through
the silent dawn rain.

581
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:11,625
Good morning, my high lord.

582
00:41:13,745 --> 00:41:16,085
We're standing here, together, waiting
for you.

583
00:41:18,665 --> 00:41:20,255
My name is Jens.

584
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:24,375
A Jens person.

585
00:41:24,825 --> 00:41:28,495
Who talks a lot during an
endless stroll.

586
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:34,165
There's a scrawny and miserable knight.

587
00:41:34,735 --> 00:41:44,445
With a whole lot of confused and
feverish thoughts under his hat.

588
00:41:47,915 --> 00:41:49,655
I'm the knight's wife.

589
00:41:54,825 --> 00:41:57,515
There's a little witch, who, from what
I've heard

590
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,895
is supposed to have pleasured herself
with the dark one.

591
00:42:00,915 --> 00:42:02,705
She was burned for her faith.

592
00:42:03,205 --> 00:42:06,105
By now she's probably
pretty disappointed.

593
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:15,275
I'm a smith by profession.

594
00:42:16,005 --> 00:42:17,035
And pretty good.

595
00:42:22,565 --> 00:42:24,105
This is my wife, Lisa.

596
00:42:25,135 --> 00:42:27,275
Curtsy for the lord, Lisa.

597
00:42:29,905 --> 00:42:32,325
She's hard to handle, sometimes.

598
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:35,955
We've had some hullabaloo, so to say.

599
00:42:36,965 --> 00:42:39,345
A bit more than most people.

600
00:42:39,825 --> 00:42:42,265
It was the jester's fault.

601
00:42:42,775 --> 00:42:44,485
Ask him yourself; he's standing
right there.

602
00:42:49,175 --> 00:42:52,405
Over there's a woman who calls
herself Maria.

603
00:42:52,715 --> 00:42:55,905
She's been running days and nights
to escape.

604
00:42:56,985 --> 00:43:00,105
Perhaps not so much for her own sake, as
for the child's.

605
00:43:01,525 --> 00:43:03,315
Now she stands there, quiet, and waits.

606
00:43:12,395 --> 00:43:15,365
I can tell you what the knight is
shouting, even if his tongue has been
stolen from him

607
00:43:15,365 --> 00:43:20,225
and only strange sounds escape him.

608
00:43:21,155 --> 00:43:26,015
Every morning he stretches his arms
towards the saints, towards god.

609
00:43:26,435 --> 00:43:30,385
Often he shouts in their holy ears for
them to hear him.

610
00:43:31,295 --> 00:43:34,795
Time and time again, he's shook by
certainty.

611
00:43:35,315 --> 00:43:40,835
Through fogs of spiritual lethargy he's
struck by god's presence

612
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:42,855
like a blow from a huge bell.

613
00:43:44,135 --> 00:43:47,085
Suddenly his emptiness is filled with
a music

614
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:51,515
without notes, but carried as if
by voices

615
00:43:52,895 --> 00:43:56,895
Then he shouts through all his
darknesses, and his shout is like
a whisper.

616
00:43:58,125 --> 00:43:59,125
To your presence, o god.

617
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:01,895
For your honour, I live.

618
00:44:02,425 --> 00:44:03,425
For your honour.

619
00:44:04,925 --> 00:44:06,255
That's what he's shouting in
the darkness.

620
00:44:08,095 --> 00:44:16,265
Then the terrible thing happens: His
certainty goes out, as if somebody blew
out a candle.

621
00:44:16,765 --> 00:44:18,705
The huge bell falls silent.

622
00:44:20,015 --> 00:44:21,425
The darkness pulses even darker.

623
00:44:21,975 --> 00:44:25,695
It forces itself through his throat and
presses against his mouth.

624
00:44:27,385 --> 00:44:30,325
The curses appear through his stomach,
his hair, his eyes.

625
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:31,875
Like a predator

626
00:44:32,285 --> 00:44:35,245
like shine small snakes

627
00:44:35,685 --> 00:44:38,125
like evil little birds with
hoarse screams

628
00:44:39,115 --> 00:44:41,715
Then his darkness is spotted by blood

629
00:44:42,105 --> 00:44:45,185
Then his wounds expand.

630
00:44:48,635 --> 00:44:52,595
With all respect for the strict lord, I
ask you to stop making those sounds.

631
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:56,125
Out there in the darkness, that you
claim to visit

632
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:59,455
where presumably we all visit like
stupid little heavenly bodies

633
00:44:59,455 --> 00:45:04,165
in that darkness you won't find anybody
to care about your complaints or
your suffering.

634
00:45:04,495 --> 00:45:07,935
So dry your tears and reflect in
your indifference.

635
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:09,895
From me you could have gotten a herb.

636
00:45:10,365 --> 00:45:12,965
To laxatively purge your problems
with eternity.

637
00:45:14,465 --> 00:45:16,235
It seems to be too late now.

638
00:45:17,185 --> 00:45:20,155
Feel, at least, in these final minutes,
the incommensurate triumph

639
00:45:20,155 --> 00:45:23,385
to be able to roll your eyes and move
your toes.

640
00:45:23,385 --> 00:45:24,385
Be silent.

641
00:45:26,925 --> 00:45:27,925
I'll be quiet.

642
00:45:28,555 --> 00:45:30,065
But under protest.

643
00:45:31,325 --> 00:45:33,525
I got a bit embarrassed, I admit that.

644
00:45:33,975 --> 00:45:37,535
But should I just give up without free
will and resistance?

645
00:45:39,655 --> 00:45:44,505
With all due respect for the
strict lord.

646
00:45:44,965 --> 00:45:45,965
Quiet.

647
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:49,405
The jester is tuning his lute.

648
00:45:50,035 --> 00:45:52,635
The strict lord is inviting us to dance.

649
00:46:04,615 --> 00:46:06,675
He wants us to hold hands.

650
00:46:07,555 --> 00:46:10,375
And then thread the dance in a long row.

651
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:13,915
First the strict lord.

652
00:46:14,995 --> 00:46:17,035
The musician brings up the rear.

653
00:46:18,785 --> 00:46:21,855
Away from the dawn we're going.

654
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:25,635
Away towards the dark country

655
00:46:25,635 --> 00:46:28,045
while the rain is washing down
our faces.

656
00:46:30,445 --> 00:46:32,925
Come to the dance, my children,
my friends.

657
00:46:33,945 --> 00:46:36,315
The strict lord is impatient.

658
00:46:37,035 --> 00:46:38,995
And the music has just...

659
00:47:17,915 --> 00:47:18,915
